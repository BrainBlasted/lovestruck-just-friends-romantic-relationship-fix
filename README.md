# Lovestruck: Ask to Just Be Friends Romantic Relationship Fix

For some reason when breaking off a romantic relationship with the "Ask to Just
Be Friends" interaction, the game does not remove romantic satisfaction or
romance dynamics from the relationship. This means despite breaking things off
officially - nullifying engagements and no longer considering the sims romantic
partners - sims would still get moody over their romantic satisfaction decaying
or get buffs for their romance dynamic.

This mod makes sure the interaction removes romantic satisfaction and romance
dynamics from the relaitionship the same way the meaner "Break Up" interaction
does, with a custom notification for this scenario.
